description: "Phased software engineering execution for large refactors, migrations, feature work, testing efforts, and modularization. Executes through strict planning, workspace setup, dependency analysis, PRD-driven parallel implementation, and merge phases. Each subagent runs in an isolated Ralph workspace (CLAUDE.md + prd.json + progress.txt) and executes the Ralph agent loop autonomously. Use when a task needs isolated workspaces, atomic commits, parallel branches, and controlled merge sequencing."

# Phased Software Engineering Execution

## Task
$ARGUMENTS

---

## Reference

Subagent execution follows the **[Ralph](https://github.com/snarktank/ralph)** pattern. Each phase workspace is a self-contained Ralph environment: `CLAUDE.md` (agent instructions), `prd.json` (story state machine), `progress.txt` (learning persistence). Subagents are autonomous — they read their workspace instructions and execute independently.

The **Sugar** library (`src/lib/`) is the source of truth for all execution logic. Skills delegate to `sugar` CLI commands for workspace management, story state, consensus, and pattern propagation. Do not embed procedural bash scripts or Python one-liners — use Sugar CLI instead.

---

## Prompt reinforcement

Use **prompt repetition** at every decision boundary: state the task, provide context, give the instruction, restate context briefly, repeat the instruction. Apply at skill level (restate `$ARGUMENTS` before each phase), subagent level (each workspace CLAUDE.md repeats the task), and per-story (restate acceptance criteria before implementing).

---

## Core behavior

Execute in **strict phases**. Never move to the next phase without **explicit user approval**.

Before every phase, restate: **"The original task is: $ARGUMENTS. This phase's goal is: [phase goal]."**

---

## Phase 1 — Planning

### Goal
Analyze the task and produce a complete execution plan. Do not implement any code.

**Restate**: The original task is `$ARGUMENTS`. This phase produces `plan.md` and `todo.md` only.

### Actions

Use the `/prd` skill approach: analyze the task, ask clarifying questions if ambiguous, then produce structured requirements.

Create `plan.md` at the repo root containing:
- objective, scope, assumptions, constraints, risks
- **dependency map** — which parts depend on other parts
- architecture / refactor / testing strategy as relevant
- execution phases with explicit dependency annotations
- blockers

Create `todo.md` at the repo root containing:
- small, actionable, idempotent tasks grouped by phase
- checkbox progress tracking (`- [ ]`)
- dependency annotations per task
- completion criteria per phase

### Rules
- Do not implement anything or create branches
- Stop after Phase 1 and wait for user approval

---

## Phase 2 — Workspace and branch setup

### Goal
Create an isolated Ralph workspace for each execution phase.

**Restate**: The original task is `$ARGUMENTS`. This phase creates one git worktree per phase, each pre-loaded with the Ralph agent structure.

### Preconditions
Only start after explicit user approval.

### Actions

Use the Sugar CLI to create workspaces:

```bash
# Create workspace for each phase
sugar workspace create <phase-name>

# List created workspaces
sugar workspace list
```

Branch naming: `phase-a-<scope>`, `phase-b-<scope>`, etc.

### Rules
- One worktree per phase, one branch per phase
- Do not start implementation unless user approves Phase 3
- Document setup problems in `plan.md`

---

## Phase 3 — Dependency analysis, PRD generation, and parallel implementation

### Preconditions
Only start after explicit user approval.

**Restate**: The original task is `$ARGUMENTS`. This phase analyzes dependencies, generates Ralph workspaces with prd.json and CLAUDE.md per phase, then launches all independent phases as parallel subagents.

Sub-phases: **3a → 3b → 3c**.

---

### Phase 3a — Dependency analysis

Read `plan.md` thoroughly. For each phase determine:

1. **Produces**: artifacts, files, APIs, types, state changes
2. **Consumes**: what it needs from other phases
3. **Hard dependencies**: must complete before this starts
4. **Soft dependencies**: helpful but not blocking
5. **Independence**: zero overlap with other phases

Build the dependency graph. Identify **parallel groups**, **sequential chains**, and the **critical path**.

---

### Phase 3b — Generate execution.md, prd.json, and CLAUDE.md per workspace

The Sugar library generates all workspace files. Use the `Orchestrator` class or CLI commands:

```bash
# Initialize config if not present
sugar config init

# The orchestrator generates: execution.md, prd.json, CLAUDE.md, VERIFY.md, ralph-loop.sh per workspace
```

For each workspace, the library generates:
- **`prd.json`** — Ralph-format user stories with consensus state machine
- **`CLAUDE.md`** — Agent instructions with iron laws, quality protocol, red flags
- **`VERIFY.md`** — Verifier agent instructions with vote format
- **`ralph-loop.sh`** — Iteration engine that spawns fresh agents per story
- **`execution.md`** at repo root — dependency graph, parallel groups, model strategy

**Story rules:** completable in one pass, ordered by dependency (schema → backend → UI), verifiable criteria, always include "Typecheck passes".

#### Rules
- Every workspace must have: `prd.json`, `progress.txt`, `CLAUDE.md`, `ralph-loop.sh`, `VERIFY.md`
- Do not proceed to 3c until all workspaces are fully set up
- Validate each `prd.json`: `sugar validate <workspace>/prd.json`

---

### Phase 3c — Parallel execution via ralph-loop.sh

#### Goal
Launch the Ralph iteration loop for each phase in parallel.

#### How iteration works

```
ralph-loop.sh (the loop — runs in bash)
  ├── Iteration 1: claude < CLAUDE.md → implements US-001 → exits
  ├── Iteration 2: claude < CLAUDE.md → implements US-002 → exits
  ├── Iteration 3: claude < CLAUDE.md → implements US-003 → outputs PHASE_COMPLETE
  └── Loop exits successfully
```

Each iteration is a **fresh agent instance with clean context**. Memory persists via:
- `prd.json` — which stories are done (`status: "passed"/"pending"/"rejected"`)
- `progress.txt` — learnings and codebase patterns
- git history — all committed code

#### Execution

Follow `execution.md` group ordering. Launch ralph loops per group:

```bash
# Launch all independent phases in parallel
/tmp/<repo>-phases/phase-a/ralph-loop.sh 20 sonnet &
/tmp/<repo>-phases/phase-b/ralph-loop.sh 20 sonnet &
wait

# Propagate patterns between groups
sugar propagate-patterns --base /tmp/<repo>-phases

# Launch next group
/tmp/<repo>-phases/phase-c/ralph-loop.sh 20 sonnet &
wait
```

The `ralph-loop.sh` uses Sugar CLI for state management:
- `sugar pick-story` — get next story
- `sugar story-update` — update story status in prd.json
- `sugar snapshot` — create git snapshot tag before each attempt

#### Model selection per phase
- **Sonnet** (default): Well-scoped implementation tasks
- **Haiku**: Mechanical tasks — config changes, boilerplate
- **Opus**: Complex architectural decisions, ambiguous requirements

Auto-escalates to Opus on 2+ consecutive failures.

#### Completion tracking
- Phase complete when `ralph-loop.sh` exits 0
- After each group: `sugar propagate-patterns` to extract and inject patterns
- Monitor progress: `sugar status-all /tmp/<repo>-phases`

#### Rules
- Never launch a dependent phase before prerequisites are confirmed complete
- Propagate codebase patterns between groups
- One story per commit, all commits must pass quality checks

---

## Phase 4 — Merge

### Goal
Safely integrate all completed phase branches.

**Restate**: The original task is `$ARGUMENTS`. All phases complete. Merge in dependency order.

### Preconditions
Only start after explicit user approval.

### Actions

```bash
# View workspace status first
sugar status-all /tmp/<repo>-phases
```

Create `merge_order.md` at repo root with:
- merge order aligned with dependency graph (foundations first)
- rationale for ordering
- expected conflict areas
- conflict resolution notes
- validation steps after each merge

**Automatic merge:**
- Merge in documented order
- Resolve conflicts using best engineering judgment
- Validate after each merge: run quality checks
- Update `merge_order.md` with actual conflict notes

### Post-merge validation
Phase 4 is **not complete** until the final merged result passes all checks.

### Cleanup

```bash
sugar workspace cleanup
```

---

## Iron Laws

Three inviolable rules enforced in every workspace:

1. **ONE STORY per iteration** — no "while I'm here" additions
2. **NEVER COMMIT BROKEN code** — every commit must pass all quality checks
3. **READ PROGRESS.TXT FIRST** — check codebase patterns before writing

## Red Flags — If You Catch Yourself Thinking:

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I'll just implement two quick stories in one iteration" | ONE story per iteration. The loop handles iteration. No exceptions. |
| "The tests mostly pass, I'll commit and fix later" | ALL commits must pass quality checks. Broken commits poison every future iteration. |
| "This dependency isn't really needed, I'll skip it" | The dependency graph exists for a reason. Never start dependent work before prerequisites complete. |
| "I know what changed, I don't need to read progress.txt" | Progress.txt IS your memory. You have NO context without it. Read it FIRST. |
| "This is a trivial change, I don't need to run checks" | Every commit gets checked. No exceptions. The one you skip is the one that breaks everything. |
| "I'll refactor this while I'm here" | Stay in scope. Implement the story. Nothing more. |

## How to interpret user requests

| User says | Start from |
|---|---|
| Planning only / no qualifier | Phase 1 |
| Planning is approved | Phase 2 |
| Setup is done | Phase 3 (3a → 3b → 3c) |
| PRDs exist, ready to implement | Phase 3c |
| All branches done, wants merge | Phase 4 |
| Testing only | Phase 1 (testing strategy), then normal flow |

---

## Execution rules

### Source of truth
- Before Phase 3c: `todo.md`
- During Phase 3c: each workspace's `prd.json`
- After each phase completes: sync back to `todo.md`

### Commits
- One per story: `feat: [Story ID] - [Story Title]`
- Must pass quality checks
- Never bundle unrelated changes

### General
- Never skip phases or continue without approval
- Keep all tracking files current
- Document assumptions and blockers explicitly
- Propagate codebase patterns between groups

---

## Managed files

| File | Location | Created in |
|---|---|---|
| `plan.md` | repo root | Phase 1 |
| `todo.md` | repo root | Phase 1 |
| `execution.md` | repo root | Phase 3b |
| `prd.json` | each worktree | Phase 3b |
| `progress.txt` | each worktree | Phase 2 |
| `CLAUDE.md` | each worktree | Phase 3b |
| `ralph-loop.sh` | each worktree | Phase 3b |
| `VERIFY.md` | each worktree | Phase 3b |
| `patterns.json` | repo root | Phase 3c (between groups) |
| `merge_order.md` | repo root | Phase 4 |

---

**The first deliverable is always Phase 1 planning only**, unless the user explicitly states that a later phase is already approved.

**Restate**: Given the task `$ARGUMENTS` — start with Phase 1. Produce `plan.md` and `todo.md`. Stop and wait for approval.
