# PRD Generator

Create detailed Product Requirements Documents that are clear, actionable, and suitable for implementation by AI agents or junior developers.

---

## The Job

1. Receive a feature description from the user
2. Ask 3-5 essential clarifying questions (with lettered options for quick responses like "1A, 2C, 3B")
3. Generate a structured PRD based on answers
4. Save to `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`

**Do NOT implement anything. Just document requirements.**

---

## Clarifying Questions

Ask only critical questions where the initial prompt is ambiguous:

```
1. What is the primary goal of this feature?
   A. Option one
   B. Option two
   C. Other: [please specify]

2. Who is the target user?
   A. New users only
   B. All users
   C. Admin users
```

## PRD Structure

### 1. Introduction/Overview
Brief description of the feature and the problem it solves.

### 2. Goals
Specific, measurable objectives (bullet list).

### 3. User Stories
Each story needs:
- **Title**: Short descriptive name
- **Description**: "As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit]"
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Verifiable checklist (not vague)

Format:
```markdown
### US-001: [Title]
**Description:** As a [user], I want [feature] so that [benefit].

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Specific verifiable criterion
- [ ] Another criterion
- [ ] Typecheck/lint passes
```

**Each story must be completable in one focused AI agent pass.** If too big, split it.

### 4. Functional Requirements
Numbered: "FR-1: The system must allow users to..."

### 5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)
What this feature will NOT include.

### 6. Technical Considerations (Optional)
Known constraints, dependencies, integration points.

### 7. Success Metrics
How success is measured.

### 8. Open Questions
Remaining unknowns.

## Story Sizing (Critical)

Right-sized:
- Add a database column and migration
- Add a UI component to an existing page
- Update a server action with new logic

Too big (split these):
- "Build the entire dashboard"
- "Add authentication"
- "Refactor the API"

**Rule of thumb:** If you cannot describe the change in 2-3 sentences, it is too big.

## Output

- **Format:** Markdown
- **Location:** `tasks/prd-[feature-name].md`
