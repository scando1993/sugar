# Systematic Debugging

## Iron Law
`IF >= 3 FIXES TRIED, STOP AND QUESTION THE ARCHITECTURE`

## Phases

### 1. Reproduce
Confirm the bug with a minimal, exact reproduction case.
- Get the exact error message and stack trace
- Write a failing test if possible
- If you cannot reproduce it, you cannot fix it

### 2. Hypothesize
Form 3 hypotheses about the root cause.
- Rank them by likelihood
- Explain the reasoning behind each
- Do NOT skip to fixing before hypothesizing

### 3. Investigate
Pick ONE investigation technique and apply it:
- **Binary search**: narrow the problem space by halving (comment out half the code, does it still fail?)
- **Trace**: follow the execution path from input to failure point
- **Instrument**: add logging/assertions at key points to observe state

### 4. Fix
Apply a minimal, targeted change that addresses the root cause.
- Explain what the fix does and why it solves the root cause
- Do NOT fix symptoms — fix root causes
- If the fix touches more than 10 lines, question whether it's minimal

### 5. Verify
Run the original reproduction case.
- It must pass
- The bug must no longer occur

### 6. Regression
Run the full test suite.
- No new failures introduced
- If regressions appear, your fix changed behavior — investigate before committing

## Red Flags — If You Catch Yourself Thinking:

| Thought | Reality |
|---|---|
| "I think I know what's wrong, let me just fix it" | You have NO hypothesis until you've reproduced. Reproduce FIRST. |
| "Let me try a different fix" (3rd time) | STOP. You're guessing. Question the architecture. |
| "The fix is too big to test incrementally" | Break it down. Every fix is testable. |
| "It works on my end" | Reproduce in the EXACT environment where it fails. |

## Rules
- NEVER skip reproduction
- NEVER apply more than 3 fixes without stepping back and questioning the architecture
- ALWAYS verify the fix doesn't introduce regressions
- Document what you tried and what you learned in progress.txt
